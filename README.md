## Introduction

This project contains solutions for the [Binary Auditing Package](http://web.archive.org/web/20170202233142/http://www.binary-auditing.com/). The author behind this package (not me) approaches reverse engineering from a different perspective. Instead of immediately start reversing crackmes, it tries to teachs you how compiled code maps to assembly language.

## Content Overview

The training package includes all necessary files to run a complete lecture for Binary Auditing and Reverse Code Engineering at university. All files are well sorted by topics and with increasing difficulty. You need Windows XP or later to use this training package. **The training package does NOT include runnable viruses!**

- HLL Mapping 1 (NOT for training, only as reference!)	98
- HLL Mapping 2 (Start here and convert them to C)	31
- Manual Decompilation (Simple exercises)	10
- Algorithm Analysis 1 (Simple math exercises)	3
- Algorithm Analysis 2 (Simple math exercises)	6
- Crash Auditing (more complicated, why crashing?)	10
- File Understanding (Simple to hard Reversemes)	31
- Copy Protection Auditing (Simple to very hard)	47
- Unpacking (Simple exercises)	3
- Vulnerability Auditing (Simple to intermediate)	38
- Malware Auditing 1 (Simple old .com/.exe exercises)	41
- Malware Auditing 2 (Some fakes for analysis)	4
- Malware Auditing 3 (Simple win32 analysis)

## Download

- You can either download the free training package from the original author of these exerercice from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20170202233142/http://www.binary-auditing.com/binary-auditing-training-package.zip)
